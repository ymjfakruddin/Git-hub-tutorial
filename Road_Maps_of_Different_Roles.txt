Are you planning to become a Spring Boot expert? 
Here's a step-by-step roadmap to guide your journey:

🍀𝟏. 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐚 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐝 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Core Java: Learn OOP principles, Collections Framework, Exception Handling, and Java 8+ features (Streams, Lambdas).
Spring Basics: Understand Dependency Injection (DI), Inversion of Control (IoC), Spring Beans, and Application Context.
Build Tools: Familiarize yourself with Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies and project builds.

🍀𝟐. 𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐭
Understand @SpringBootApplication and embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty).
Use Spring Initializr to create projects with the necessary dependencies.
Learn how to manage configurations with application.properties or application.yml.

🍀𝟑. 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬
Database Integration: Use Spring Data JPA for ORM, map entities, and perform CRUD operations.
Security: Secure APIs with Spring Security, implement OAuth2/JWT, and manage user roles.
Service Layer: Organize business logic using @Service and handle transactions with @Transactional.
Global Error Handling: Centralize exception handling with @ControllerAdvice and custom error responses.

🍀𝟒. 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐎𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬
Use WebClient or RestTemplate for external API calls.
Implement messaging systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven communication.
Enable file uploads/downloads and integrate email services with JavaMailSender.

🍀𝟓. 𝐅𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
Write unit tests for controllers, services, and repositories using JUnit 5 and Mockito.
Perform integration testing with @SpringBootTest and mock external APIs.

🍀𝟔. 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬
Design microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
Implement service discovery with Eureka and API routing with Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway.
Add fault tolerance with circuit breakers like Resilience4j or Hystrix.

🍀𝟕. 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
Package applications as JAR or WAR and deploy to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerized deployments.
Monitor health and metrics with Spring Boot Actuator, Prometheus, and Grafana.
