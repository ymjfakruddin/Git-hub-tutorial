Core Java: Learn OOP principles, Collections Framework, Exception Handling, and Java 8+ features (Streams, Lambdas).
Spring Basics: Understand Dependency Injection (DI), Inversion of Control (IoC), Spring Beans, and Application Context.
Build Tools: Familiarize yourself with Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies and project builds.

🍀𝟐. 𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐭
Understand @SpringBootApplication and embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty).
Use Spring Initializr to create projects with the necessary dependencies.
Learn how to manage configurations with application.properties or application.yml.

🍀𝟑. 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬
Database Integration: Use Spring Data JPA for ORM, map entities, and perform CRUD operations.
Security: Secure APIs with Spring Security, implement OAuth2/JWT, and manage user roles.
Service Layer: Organize business logic using @Service and handle transactions with @Transactional.
Global Error Handling: Centralize exception handling with @ControllerAdvice and custom error responses.

🍀𝟒. 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐎𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬
Use WebClient or RestTemplate for external API calls.
Implement messaging systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven communication.
Enable file uploads/downloads and integrate email services with JavaMailSender.

🍀𝟓. 𝐅𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
Write unit tests for controllers, services, and repositories using JUnit 5 and Mockito.
Perform integration testing with @SpringBootTest and mock external APIs.

🍀𝟔. 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬
Design microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
Implement service discovery with Eureka and API routing with Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway.
Add fault tolerance with circuit breakers like Resilience4j or Hystrix.

🍀𝟕. 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
Package applications as JAR or WAR and deploy to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerized deployments.
Monitor health and metrics with Spring Boot Actuator, Prometheus, and Grafana.

Data engineering interviews will be 18x easier if you follow this 20 Day Roadmap to master ETL Pipelines.

𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭-𝟱)
→ ETL Basics: Learn extraction, transformation, and loading concepts.
→ Data Extraction: Work with APIs, files (CSV/JSON), and databases.
→ Data Transformation: Clean and shape data using Pandas or PySpark.
→ Data Loading: Load data into relational databases or data lakes.

𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟲-𝟭𝟬)
→ Orchestration: Build workflows with Apache Airflow.
→ Batch Processing: Use Spark for large-scale periodic data processing.
→ Real-Time Processing: Stream data with Kafka and process using Spark Streaming.

𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭𝟭-𝟭𝟱)
→ Scalability: Optimize with data partitioning and indexing.
→ Query Optimization: Improve performance with caching and execution plans.
→ Monitoring: Set up alerts and track metrics using Grafana or Prometheus.

𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭𝟲-𝟮𝟬)
→ Fault Tolerance: Add retries, checkpoints, and replication.
→ Security: Ensure compliance with encryption and access controls.
→ Capstone Project: Build an end-to-end ETL pipeline (API → Spark → Snowflake).

This isn't just a learning path. This is your ticket to becoming data engineering professional.

→ Now, if you're aiming for top data engineering roles Start Early, Learn the essentials, practice, and build real projects.

And if you need guidance, I’d suggest getting help from industry veterans at Bosscoder Academy.
